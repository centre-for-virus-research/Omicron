# EVADE project: Omicron study

This repository contains files relating to the vaccine effectiveness calculations in Willett et al. (2022) "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron is an immune escape variant with an altered cell entry pathway".

### Background and funding

This work is part of the EVADE (**E**valuation of **V**ariants **A**voiding **DE**ployed Covid-19 Vaccines) project.

This research is part of the Data and Connectivity National Core Study, led by Health Data Research UK in partnership with the Office for National Statistics and funded by UK Research and Innovation (grant ref MC_PC_20058). This work was also supported by The Alan Turing Institute via ‘Towards Turing 2.0’ EPSRC Grant Funding.

### R script for vaccine effectiveness calculations

The R script [modelling_DeltaVOmicron.R](modelling_DeltaVOmicron.R) contains the R code for modelling and calculating the vaccine effectiveness for those tested between 6th and 26th December 2021.
